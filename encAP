📝 Practice Question
Create a Python class called BankAccount with the following requirements:

Private attribute: __balance (initially set to 0).

Getter method: get_balance() → returns the current balance.

Setter method: set_balance(amount) → updates the balance, but only if amount is non-negative. If a negative value is passed, print "Invalid balance amount".

Add a method deposit(amount) that increases the balance (only if amount > 0).

Add a method withdraw(amount) that decreases the balance (only if amount <= current balance).

Finally, write a short script to:

Create an object of BankAccount.

Try setting the balance to a negative number (to test validation).

Deposit some money.

Withdraw some money.

Print the final balance using the getter.



output:


Invalid balance amount
Balance after deposit: 500
Balance after withdrawal: 200
Final balance: 200
